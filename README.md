# Documentation for the Code

## Overview
The code provided consists of four files: `README.md`, `shapes_ap.py`, `config.yml`, and `shapes_ap.js`. These files appear to be part of a project that defines shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, and provides methods to calculate their areas and perimeters.

## Inputs

*   The code does not have any explicit input parameters. However, it is designed to work with various shape objects, which are created using the classes defined in the `shapes_ap.py` file.
*   The `config.yml` file contains configuration settings for an API key, GitHub API key, client base URL, and model name.

## Outputs

*   The code outputs the areas and perimeters of the shapes created. These values are calculated based on the dimensions provided to the shape objects.
*   In the example usage section of `shapes_ap.py`, the code prints error messages when attempting to create invalid shapes (e.g., a rectangle with negative width or a circle with a non-numeric radius).

## Classes and Methods

### Shapes Ap (Python)

*   The `Shape` class is an abstract base class that defines methods for calculating the area and perimeter of shapes.
*   The `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle` classes inherit from the `Shape` class and implement their respective area and perimeter calculation methods.

### Shapes Ap (JavaScript)

*   This code is similar to the Python version, defining a `Shape` class as an abstract base class with `area()` and
